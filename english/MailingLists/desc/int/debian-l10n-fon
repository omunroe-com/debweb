Fongbé is the most popular speaking language of Benin. Benin is a West Africa Country near Nigeria. About 2020, local languages will be adopted for learning in schools and universities. Unfortunately, there is no operating system which has this language integrated. People cannot write in Fongbé using their computer and it very difficult to publish paper in fongbé. That's why we are working to solve this issue.
