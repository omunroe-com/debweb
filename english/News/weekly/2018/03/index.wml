<p><b>Happy 25th Anniversary Debian!</b></p>

<p>This year's annual Debian birthday celebration, known as <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay">DebianDay</a>, was an even
more special occasion as it marked a <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2018/08/debian-is-25.html">quarter century</a> of excellence, development,
contributions, translations, software creation, advocacy, and all things Debian.
Celebrations were held all over the world and several Debian designers created 
some amazing artwork, logos, posters, and images which we shared online.</p>

<p>Thank you Debian Developers and Contributors for all that you do!

<p><b>Updated Debian 9 and Debian 8: 9.5 and 8.11 released</b></p>
<p>The Debian project <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20180714">announced</a> 
the fifth update of its stable distribution Debian 9 (codename <q>Stretch</q>) on 14 July 2018 
to point release 9.5.</p>

<p>The Debian project also <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20180623">announced</a>
the eleventh and final update of its oldstable distribution Debian 8 (codenameÂ <q>Jessie</q>) on 23 June 2018
to point release 8.11.</p>

<p>These point releases added corrections for security issues
along with a few adjustments for serious problems.
Security advisories have already been published separately and are referenced where available.

Upgrading an existing installation to either revision can be achieved
by pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at: <a href="https://www.debian.org/mirror/list">https://www.debian.org/mirror/list</a>
</p>


<p><b>Alioth Migration to Salsa</b></p>
Alexander Wirt <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/06/msg00001.html">announced</a> that <q>Alioth is gone</q> after the archiving of the last remaining VCS repositories. Alioth, which ran on Fusionforge, served as the repository
for collaborative maintenance of packages in Debian from 2003 through 2018. After some
discussion and a dedicated <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/06/msg00002.html">sprint</a> about future
options, Alioth was replaced with a GitLab instance at <a href="https://salsa.debian.org">salsa.debian.org</a>
which came out of beta testing in early 2018.</p>
<p>
Debian Developers and projects should have already migrated over to the new
system; additional information on the migration is <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/AliothMigration">available</a>.</p>

<p><b>Debian Data Protection Team announced</p></b>
<p>Chris Lamb <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/06/msg00000.html">announced</a> the creation and delegation
of the Debian Data Protection team. The team will serve as the centralized point for queries
regarding Debian's use and care of personal information across the project and
guidance on data protection principles.</p>

<p><b>Latest team features of Debian Package Tracker</b></p>
<p>Raphael Hertzog <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/07/msg00001.html">shared</a> the latest team features of the Debian Package Tracker. New 
to the tracker are helpful attributes for email address team identification,
discussion subscriptions, and automatic maintainer and uploader fields along
with many other features.</p>

<p><b>vmdebootstrap to be removed September 2018</b></p>
<p>Lars Wirzenius <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/07/msg00002.html">encouraged</a> users of the vmdebootstrap package to switch to
other available tools prior to its removal from the archive September 2018.
The package, used for automatically building system images, is
somewhat difficult to modify and test due to its architecture. As other
tools are available users are advised to change now.</p>

<p><b>Debian Policy 4.2.0.0 released</b></p>
<p>Sean Whitton <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2018/08/msg00000.html">announced<a/> Debian Policy 4.2.0.0 being released and uploaded to sid. The announcement details the changes from Policy 4.1.5.
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">The Debian Policy Manual</a> deals with the structure and contents
of the Debian archive, technical requirements each package must satisfy to be included in
the archive, and the package management system developers have to be conversant with.</p>

<p><b>DebConf18 Videos are available</b></p>
Video recordings from DebConf18 are <a href="https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2018/DebConf18/">available</a>; special thanks to the DebConf
Video Team for their amazing work covering this event.
Wouter Verhelst <a href="https://grep.be/blog//en/life/debian/DebConf18_video_work/">wrote</a> about the software used for the transcoding and the
different formats available for download. The schedule page on the DebConf18
