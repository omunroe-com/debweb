The Mirrors.masterlist is maintained by the mirror team <mirrors@debian.org>
in git.  A publicly accessible repository is on Salsa [repo].

Please submit your changes to the mirror team by email to mirrors@debian.org or
directly push to the masterlist git repo if you have access.

A cronjob on www-master.debian.org will fetch the updates from the repo and 
set a symbolic link so the Makefile can use the updated file.
