Build requirements
------------------

There are a range of tools needed to build even the basic bits of the
website, and then some extra/optional packages that you'll need for
some of the translations. Here's a (probably incomplete!) list...

Basics:

 * git             (you probably have this already if you're reading this!)
 * wget            (the build will use wget to grab some files as it runs)
 * wml             (the templating engine we use)
 * libxml-rss-perl (for building Debian Weekly News RDF files)

Translations:

 * opencc          (Chinese translation conversions)

To see the results of a build before pushing it out to the mirror network 
you can build in www-master.debian.org and then have a look at:
