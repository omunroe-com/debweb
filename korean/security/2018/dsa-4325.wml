<p>It was discovered that mosquitto, an MQTT broker, was vulnerable to
remote denial-of-service attacks that could be mounted using various
vectors.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10-3+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of mosquitto please refer to
